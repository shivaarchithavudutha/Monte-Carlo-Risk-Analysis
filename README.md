# Monte-Carlo-Risk-Analysis
Simulating asset price paths using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) to calculate Value at Risk (VaR)
# Monte Carlo Simulation for Financial Risk Analysis

This project was developed for the **JPMorgan Chase Women in Quantitative Finance Mentorship Program**.

## Project Objective
To model the potential future price paths of an asset using **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)** and quantify market risk through **Value at Risk (VaR)** and **Expected Shortfall (CVaR)**.

## Methodology
- **Stochastic Modeling:** Utilizing GBM to account for drift (expected return) and volatility (market risk).
- **Risk Metrics:** Calculating the 95% and 99% confidence intervals for potential losses.
- **Simulation:** 10,000+ iterations to ensure statistical convergence.

## Tech Stack
- Python (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for distribution visualization
